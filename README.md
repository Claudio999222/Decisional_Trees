# Decision Trees Classifier

## Overview

This notebook showcases the application of Decision Trees, a versatile machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees work by recursively splitting the dataset based on features, creating a tree-like structure that leads to decision-making.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Decision Trees**: A predictive modeling approach that uses a tree-like model of decisions to make predictions.

2. **Nodes and Leaves**: Nodes represent decision points based on features, and leaves represent the predicted outcome.

3. **Entropy and Information Gain**: Decision Trees use entropy and information gain to decide how to split the data at each node.

4. **Hyperparameters**: Parameters that control the behavior of the Decision Tree, such as the maximum depth, minimum samples for a split, and others.

## Application:

- **Classification Tasks**: Decision Trees are commonly used for classification problems, where the goal is to assign a label to an input based on its features.

- **Regression Tasks**: Decision Trees can be adapted for regression tasks by predicting a continuous target variable.

## Demonstration:

In this notebook, I apply Decision Trees to the famous Iris dataset, classifying different species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal characteristics. The demonstration includes data exploration, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

Key steps in the notebook:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure and features of the Iris dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling any missing values and encoding categorical variables if needed.

3. **Model Training**: Using scikit-learn to train a Decision Trees classifier.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploring the impact of hyperparameters on model performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

This demonstration provides insights into the application of Decision Trees, their interpretability, and considerations for optimal model performance.
